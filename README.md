## Form Mage


</div>

### Description

This is the source code to a custom control that will give you more power to work with VB forms.

Extra properties, functions, and events including FormMoved, SysTray Icon, Form Shape etc.

This is a useful tool even if I do say so myself, I use it and you will notice that if you down load my next Upload called System Mage (Wait and see!)

WARNING: Terry has pointed out a glaring error in my code that has baffled me.

Somewhere along the line I have coded an error into the property page that causes an error and I haven't located it yet.

I'm going to warn everyone about it until I fix it but leave it on here so you can still use the example of the functions in the control. If you see my mistake then pls let me know!

Cheers.
